# Web-Application-Uni

Created for MSc Computing Science module 'Internet and Multimedia Techniques'.

A module in my first semester, this project is the product of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js from scratch. 

The assignment asked for a site to be created for a fictional hotel, providing both public-facing and staff versions. The public website needed a basic but appealing front-end, while also allowing a customer to follow a booking process for a specified room/set of dates. Additionally, the site allows for customers to select a set of dates for a particular room, and to see alternative suggestions if those dates are unavailable.

The staff site provides a basic interface allowing rooms to be assigned a check-in/out status, select whether a room has been cleaned, and attach a note to the room. It also allows staff to view customer details, including booking dates, payment information and outstanding balances as well as taking 'payment' (payment is simulated and not attached to any payment system) for those outstanding charges.

Finally, the backend links up with a postgres database that contains the customer and hotel data.
